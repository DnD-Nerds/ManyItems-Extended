You're insane if you think I have anything else to give you to contact me on
And uh if you bomb my Discord you die. That's a promise.



The README is a guide on how to use the app, a changelog, and answers to questions
you may have.


**Data Saving**
Use __sync.bat__ to upload your new saves and/or get saves from the cloud.

**GUI Updates**
Use __update.bat__ to upload changes to the GUI. Please do not use that file if you're just syncing saves.


Weapon Creation:
-- Weapon creation is currently the only item available to create since this is the Alpha --

If this is your first-time use, you'll need to click on "New Weapon".
You'll then get the base window for a weapon. Don't worry, there's plenty more windows
and doohickeys that're gonna be made. Good luck keeping track of it all :)

At the top are three stats.
